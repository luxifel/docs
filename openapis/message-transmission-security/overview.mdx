title: Message Transmission Security
description: Security requirements for API communication including signing and signature validation.
---

Message signing and signature validation is mandatory for all requests and responses. This ensures message authenticity, integrity, and non-repudiation.

## Security Architecture

The platform enforces a two-layer security approach:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Request Signing" icon="pen-to-square">
    All outgoing requests must be digitally signed before transmission
  </Card>

  <Card title="Response Validation" icon="shield-check">
    All incoming responses must have their signatures verified before processing
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Why Signing is Required

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Authentication">
    Digital signatures prove that the request originated from an authorized party with access to the private key.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Integrity">
    Any modification to the signed content invalidates the signature, ensuring data hasn't been tampered with in transit.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Non-Repudiation">
    The sender cannot deny having sent a signed message, providing an audit trail for all transactions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Replay Protection">
    The `Request-Time` header prevents old requests from being replayed by attackers.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Key Management

### Key Requirements

| Requirement | Specification |
|-------------|---------------|
| Algorithm | RSA with SHA-256 (RSA256) |
| Key Size | 2048 bits minimum |
| Format | PEM or PKCS#8 |

### Key Pair Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate Key Pair">
    Generate a 2048-bit RSA key pair using OpenSSL or your preferred tool

    ```bash
    # Generate private key
    openssl genrsa -out private_key.pem 2048

    # Extract public key
    openssl rsa -in private_key.pem -pubout -out public_key.pem
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Share Public Key">
    Provide your public key to Rebell during onboarding. This key will be used to verify your request signatures.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Receive Platform Public Key">
    Receive Rebell's public key to verify response signatures.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Secure Storage">
    Store your private key securely. Never expose it in client-side code or version control.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Security Best Practices

<Checks>
  - Use 2048-bit or larger RSA keys
  - Store private keys in secure key management systems
  - Never hardcode private keys in source code
  - Rotate keys periodically according to your security policy
  - Always verify response signatures before processing data
  - Validate the `Response-Time` header to detect replay attacks
  - Use HTTPS for all API communications
</Checks>

<Warning>
**Private Key Security**: Your private key should never be exposed. If you suspect your private key has been compromised, contact Rebell support immediately to rotate your keys.
</Warning>
