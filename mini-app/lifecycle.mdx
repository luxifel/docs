This section describes the lifecycle of a Mini App, from initial creation to publication and ongoing maintenance.

Understanding this lifecycle helps merchants plan development, testing, and release activities correctly.

## Lifecycle Overview

A Mini App progresses through the following stages:

    A[Create] --> B[Develop]
    B --> C[Test]
    C --> D[Submit]
    D --> E[Review]
    E --> F{Approved?}
    F -->|Yes| G[Publish]
    F -->|No| B
    G --> H[Maintain]
    H --> B
```

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create">
    Register Mini App and set up project
  </Step>

  <Step title="Develop">
    Build UI, logic, and backend integrations
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test">
    Validate functionality in sandbox
  </Step>

  <Step title="Submit">
    Package and submit for review
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review">
    Rebell reviews for compliance and quality
  </Step>

  <Step title="Publish">
    Release to production users
  </Step>

  <Step title="Maintain">
    Bug fixes, updates, and versioning
  </Step>
</Steps>

Each stage has a specific purpose and set of responsibilities.

## Create

The lifecycle begins with the **creation** of a Mini App project.

At this stage:

- A new Mini App is registered in the **Rebell developer console**
- A unique **Mini App identifier** is assigned
- The **Mini App type** is selected (Native or H5)
- Basic **metadata** is defined (name, description, category)

<Info>
Creation does **not** make the Mini App visible to users. It only establishes the project container used during development.
</Info>

### Registration Information

| Field | Description | Required |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| Mini App Name | Display name in SuperApp | Yes |
| Description | Short description of service | Yes |
| Category | Service category (e.g., Food, Transport) | Yes |
| Mini App Type | Native or H5 | Yes |
| Icon | App icon for display | Yes |

## Develop

During development:

<Warning>
At this stage, the Mini App exists **only in the sandbox environment**.

<Tip>
Only Mini Apps that pass internal testing should proceed to submission.
</Tip>

## Submit

Once development and testing are complete, the Mini App is **submitted for review**.

Submission involves:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Package">
    Mini App code is packaged for deployment
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Environment">
    Choose target environment (typically production)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Provide Metadata">
    Supply required metadata and documentation
  </Step>

  <Step title="Submit">
    Submit package to Rebell for review
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Submission **freezes** the version being reviewed. Further changes require creating a new version.
</Warning>

### Submission Requirements

| Requirement | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Functionality** | All features working as documented |
| **Metadata** | Complete and accurate app information |
| **Screenshots** | Screenshots for store listing |
| **Privacy Policy** | Privacy policy URL (if collecting user data) |
| **Test Accounts** | Test credentials for reviewers (if needed) |

## Review

Rebell performs a review before allowing publication.

</Tabs>

<Info>
Review timelines and criteria are defined by Rebell and may vary by Mini App category.
</Info>

## Publish

After approval, the Mini App can be **published to production**.

Publishing:

- Makes the Mini App **available to real users**
- Activates **production configuration**
- Enables **live payments**

<Warning>
Publication is an **explicit action** and does not occur automatically after approval.
</Warning>

### Pre-Publication Checklist

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Backend Readiness">
    - [ ] Production backend deployed
    - [ ] Production credentials configured
    - [ ] Webhook endpoints ready
    - [ ] Monitoring enabled
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Configuration">
    - [ ] Production API endpoints configured
    - [ ] Production credentials active
    - [ ] Sandbox references removed
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Operational Readiness">
    - [ ] Support team briefed
    - [ ] Runbook prepared
    - [ ] Escalation paths defined
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Maintain

After publication, the Mini App enters the **maintenance phase**.

Maintenance includes:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Bug Fixes" icon="bug">
    Address issues reported by users
  </Card>
  <Card title="Feature Enhancements" icon="sparkles">
    Add new capabilities
  </Card>
  <Card title="Performance" icon="gauge-high">
    Optimize performance
  </Card>
  <Card title="Security Updates" icon="lock">
    Address security issues
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Info>
Each update:
- Requires a **new version**
- Follows the same **submit → review → publish** process
</Info>

## Versioning & Rollback

Mini Apps are versioned explicitly.

### Versioning Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Version per release** | Each release corresponds to a version |
| **Multiple internal versions** | Multiple versions may exist internally |
| **Single active version** | Only one version is active for users |
| **Immutable releases** | Published versions cannot be modified |

### Rollback

Rollback is available for risk mitigation:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="When to Rollback">
    - Critical bug discovered after release
    - Performance degradation in production
    - Security vulnerability identified
    - Compliance issue detected
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Rollback Process">
    - Requires explicit action through the platform
    - Reverts to a **previously approved version**
    - Does not bypass review requirements for new changes
    - Should be followed by a proper fix submission
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Warning>
Versioning and rollback are essential for safe long-term operation. Always maintain at least one stable previous version.
</Warning>
