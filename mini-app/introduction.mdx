title: Introduction to Mini Apps
description: Understand what Mini Apps are, when to use them, and how they compare to Payment API integrations.
---

Mini Apps are lightweight applications that run inside the **Rebell SuperApp**, allowing merchants and partners to provide digital services without distributing standalone mobile applications.

They are designed to deliver **interactive, multi-step user experiences** that can seamlessly integrate payments, user identity, and merchant backend services.

<Info>
Mini Apps are **not** payment APIs. They are embedded applications executed within the Rebell runtime and accessed directly by users from the SuperApp.
</Info>

## What Is a Mini App

A Mini App is:

- A **sandboxed application** executed inside the Rebell SuperApp
- Built using a **JavaScript-based Mini Program framework**
- **Distributed and updated** centrally through Rebell
- Capable of interacting with both **Rebell APIs** and **merchant backend systems**

Mini Apps allow merchants to deliver services such as:

  <Card title="Service Management" icon="gear">
    Subscription management, account settings, support

</CardGroup>

All without requiring users to install a separate app.

## What a Mini App Is NOT

<Warning>
A Mini App is **not**:

- A standalone mobile application
- A replacement for server-to-server Payment APIs
- A backend system
- A generic web page embedded in a webview
</Warning>

Mini Apps rely on a **merchant backend** for business logic and persistent data. Rebell serves only as the execution and distribution environment.

## Mini Apps vs Payment API Integration

Rebell supports two complementary integration models. Choose based on your existing infrastructure and user experience goals.

  <Tab title="Payment API Integration">
    **Best suited when you already have:**

    - A mobile app or website
    - A POS or backend-driven checkout
    - A need for payment-only functionality

    **Characteristics:**

    - Server-to-server APIs
    - Merchant controls the UI
    - Payments are initiated externally
    - Ideal for ecommerce and POS

    **Learn more:** [Payment Integration Guide](/payment-integration/quick-integration-guide)
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Mini App Integration">
    **Best suited when you want to:**

    - Offer a complete digital service inside the SuperApp
    - Guide users through multiple steps
    - Leverage Rebell-native navigation and identity
    - Embed payments as part of a service flow

    **Characteristics:**

    - Runs inside Rebell SuperApp
    - Uses Mini App framework and JSAPI
    - UI is hosted and rendered by Rebell
    - Payments are part of the user journey

### Comparison Summary

| Aspect | Payment APIs | Mini Apps |
|--------|--------------|-----------|
| **Execution** | Merchant backend | Rebell SuperApp |
| **UI ownership** | Merchant | Rebell-hosted |
| **Use case** | Checkout / POS | Full service experience |
| **User context** | External | Native SuperApp |
| **Payment support** | Yes | Yes (embedded) |
| **Distribution** | Merchant-managed | Rebell-managed |

<Tip>
Mini Apps and Payment APIs can be **combined**: a Mini App may call merchant backend APIs, which in turn interact with Rebell Payment APIs.
</Tip>

## High-Level Architecture

At a conceptual level, a Mini App involves three main actors:

    User[User] --> SuperApp[Rebell SuperApp]
    SuperApp --> Runtime[Mini App Runtime]
    Runtime --> Backend[Merchant Backend]
    Backend --> PaymentAPI[Rebell Payment APIs]

    style SuperApp fill:#bbdefb
    style Runtime fill:#90caf9
    style Backend fill:#64b5f6
    style PaymentAPI fill:#42a5f5
```

- The **Mini App** handles user interaction and UI
- The **merchant backend** handles business logic and data
- **Payments** are initiated either from the Mini App UI or via backend calls

This separation ensures security, scalability, and regulatory compliance.

## When to Choose a Mini App

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Choose a Mini App when...">
    - The service requires **multiple user interactions**
    - The experience should live **entirely inside the SuperApp**
    - You want to leverage Rebell's **identity and navigation**
    - You want **centralized updates** without app store releases
    - You need a **native-feeling** experience for users
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do NOT choose a Mini App if...">
    - You only need a **payment button** or API-based checkout
    - You already have a mobile app that handles the full user journey
    - Your use case is **purely transactional** without UI flow
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
