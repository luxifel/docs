description: Complete technical reference for the Rebell Payments API with request/response schemas, authentication, and testing.
---

This section provides the complete technical specification for the Rebell Payments API. Use this reference alongside the [Payment Integration guides](/payment-integration/quick-integration-guide) for implementation details and best practices.

<Warning>
Sandbox and production use separate credentials. Keys registered in sandbox do not carry over to production.
</Warning>

## Authentication

All API requests require RSA-SHA256 signature authentication. Every request must include these headers:

| Header | Required | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `Client-Id` | Yes | Your merchant identifier |
| `Request-Time` | Yes | ISO 8601 UTC timestamp (e.g., `2024-01-10T12:22:30Z`) |
| `Signature` | Yes | RSA signature: `algorithm=SHA256withRSA, keyVersion=<n>, signature=<base64>` |
| `Content-Type` | Yes | Must be `application/json` |

### Signature Construction

The signature is computed over a signing string built from:

```
<HTTP_METHOD> <HTTP_PATH>
<Client-Id>.<Request-Time>.<REQUEST_BODY>
```

**Example signing string:**

```
POST /v1/payments/retailPay
2022091495540562874792.2024-01-10T12:22:30Z.{"productCode":"51051000101000100040",...}
```

<Info>
For detailed signing implementation with code examples in Node.js, Python, and Java, see [Authentication & Environments](/payment-integration/authentication-environments) or the [Authentication Deep Dive](/payment-integration/authentication-deep-dive).
</Info>

## Request Format

All requests use JSON with the following conventions:

- **Amounts** are specified in minor units (cents). Example: `1250` = €12.50
- **Timestamps** use ISO 8601 format in UTC (with `Z` suffix)
- **IDs** must be unique per transaction (`paymentRequestId` serves as idempotency key)

```json Example Request Body
{
  "productCode": "51051000101000100040",
  "paymentRequestId": "order-123-abc",
  "paymentAmount": {
    "currency": "EUR",
    "value": 1250
  },
  "order": {
    "orderDescription": "Coffee order"
  }
}
```

## Response Format

All responses include a `result` object indicating the outcome:

```json Success Response
{
  "result": {
    "resultStatus": "S",
    "resultCode": "SUCCESS",
    "resultMessage": "Success"
  },
  "paymentId": "2024032100123456",
  "paymentRequestId": "order-123-abc"
}
```

### Result Status Codes

| Status | Meaning | Action |
|--------|---------|--------|
| `S` | Success | Transaction completed successfully |
| `F` | Failure | Transaction failed - check `resultCode` for details |
| `U` | Unknown | Indeterminate state - use Inquiry API to check status |
| `A` | Accepted | Request accepted, processing asynchronously |

<Warning>
**Never assume the initial API response is final.** Always implement webhooks to receive the authoritative payment result.
</Warning>

## Available Endpoints

### Payments

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/v1/payments/createQROrder` | POST | Create a merchant-presented QR code for payment |
| `/v1/payments/retailPay` | POST | Process payment from customer-presented QR/barcode |
| `/v1/payments/linkPayCreate` | POST | Create a redirect link for app-to-app payment |
| `/v1/payments/inquiryPayment` | POST | Query payment status |

### Webhooks

| Endpoint | Direction | Description |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| Your webhook URL | Rebell → Merchant | Receives payment notifications (`payment.succeeded`, `payment.failed`) |

## Error Handling

When a request fails, the response includes error details:

```json Error Response
{
  "result": {
    "resultStatus": "F",
    "resultCode": "INVALID_SIGNATURE",
    "resultMessage": "Request signature validation failed"
  }
}
```

### Common Error Codes

| Code | Description | Resolution |
|------|-------------|------------|
| `INVALID_SIGNATURE` | Signature validation failed | Verify signing string construction and key |
| `TIMESTAMP_INVALID` | Request-Time outside ±5 minute window | Sync server clock with NTP |
| `INVALID_CLIENT_ID` | Client-Id not recognized | Verify credentials for correct environment |
| `ORDER_NOT_EXIST` | Payment/order not found | Verify paymentId or paymentRequestId |
| `REPEAT_REQUEST` | Duplicate paymentRequestId | Use unique ID for each transaction |

For complete error reference, see [Error Handling & Result Codes](/payment-integration/error-handling).

## Rate Limits

| Environment | Limit |
|-------------|-------|
| Sandbox | 100 requests/minute |
| Production | Contact Rebell for limits based on your integration |

## Testing in Sandbox

The sandbox environment simulates the full payment flow:

1. **Create payments** using test credentials
2. **Simulate user actions** - payments auto-complete after creation
3. **Receive webhooks** to your configured endpoint
4. **Query status** using the Inquiry API

<Tip>
Test all error scenarios in sandbox before going to production. See the [Testing Checklist](/payment-integration/quick-integration-guide#testing-checklist) for comprehensive test cases.
</Tip>
